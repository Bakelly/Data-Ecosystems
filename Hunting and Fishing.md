# Hunting and Fishing Data

## Source

In many (all?) states, this is regulated at the state level, rather than by localities. Although there are federal and international regulations (e.g., under the Migratory Bird Treaty Act), those are reflected in state regulations.

# Types of data

* Hunting seasons, including species, weapon, locality, and license required (with regulatory citations)
* Fishing seasons, including species, method (line, net, spear, etc.), and size (with regulatory citations)
* Game check station locations and hours
* Annual catch/kill limits

# Examples of uses

* A smartphone app to allow somebody to identify whether they can keep the fish they just caught
* Incorporating game check stations and hours into Google Maps / Apple Maps to allow people to find the closest one
* A website to look up the closest place to hunt whitetail deer on the first weekend in December
* Purchase of a hunting/fishing license or a permit for hunting beyond the bag limit (e.g., "Bonus Deer Permit")
