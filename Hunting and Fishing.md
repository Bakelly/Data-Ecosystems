# Hunting and Fishing Data

## Source

In many (all?) states, this is regulated at the state level, rather than by localities. Although there are federal and international regulations (e.g., under the Migratory Bird Treaty Act), those are reflected in state regulations.

## Types of data

* Hunting seasons, including species, weapon, locality, and license required (with regulatory citations)
* Fishing seasons, including species, method (line, net, spear, etc.), and size (with regulatory citations)
* Game check station locations and hours
* Annual catch/kill limits
* Game guide, including image, name, alternate names, identification guide, best places to find it, and techniques for harvesting it
* Public lands/waters list, including location, whether a permit is required, services, season, and hours
* Boat ramps and water access points, including municipality, body of water, access area, type of access, and location
* State record data (e.g., largest fish), including species, weight, location, date, and the person's name

## Examples of uses

* A smartphone app to allow somebody to identify whether they can keep the fish they just caught
* Incorporating game check stations and hours into Google Maps / Apple Maps to allow people to find the closest one
* A website to look up the closest place to hunt whitetail deer on the first weekend in December
* Purchase of a hunting/fishing license or a permit for hunting beyond the bag limit (e.g., "Bonus Deer Permit")

## Notes

* The geographic boundaries of regions defined in hunting statutes do not necessarily adhere to municipal boundaries
  * For example, in Virginia, there are different hunting seasons for Canada geese for west of I-95 and east of I-95
  * Also in Virginia, Canada geese cannot be hunted within the Amelia and Dick Cross Wildlife Management Area.
* Acceptable hours of hunting can vary during a season
  * For example, in Virginia, Canada geese can be hunted until 30 minutes after sunset from September 2–14, but only until sunset from September 15–25.
