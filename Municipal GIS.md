# Municipal GIS Data

## Source

Many (all?) municipalities have GIS data about that municipality, and frequently have departments of employees whose job is the production and management of that data. This would presumably need to be acquired directly from municipalities, unless there are one or more existing timely, authoritative aggregators.

## Types of data

* property boundaries
* assessments
* zoning
* easements

## Examples of uses

* creating a centralized repository of GIS data for an MSA/state/country
* collecting a single type of data that crosses municipal boundaries
  * show every 2 acre parcel zoned "commercial," fronting a state highway, assessed at less than $100,000, that's within 20 miles of a given city
  * map the route of a buried water pipe across six counties
