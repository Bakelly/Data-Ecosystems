# Document Topographer

@jsfenfen developed [What Word Where?](https://github.com/jsfenfen/whatwordwhere), a tool that uses hOCR data to create near-literal document topography—that is, GIS data. We need to modularize this, so that it can stand alone—preferably a command-line tool that takes a PDF and generates GIS data.

More details about this are available on @jsfenfen's repository.
