# Extension Agency Libraries

Every state extension agency (e.g., [Ohio](http://ohioline.osu.edu/)) maintains a library of documents of aid to farmers and homeownersâ€”identify noxious weeds, mosquito pest management, orchard spray rates, etc. Each extension agency has hundreds of these, and they almost always seem to have been written by experts in that state, despite that they surely have broader applicability. Can't these be indexed, provided as bulk data, and used for some more valuable purpose?
