# Data Ecosystems

Ideas and plans for developing new ecosystems of open data.

The idea here is not just to identify useful datasets, but instead types of data that can be a) published on an ongoing, timely basis b) useful to the public in a meaningful way and c) mediated, improved, or targeted via a private-sector partner, for whom it is in their self interest to continue to both receive that data and publish that data.
